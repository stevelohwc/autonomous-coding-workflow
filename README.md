# Autonomous Coding Workflow Prototype

This repository serves as a prototype for an autonomous coding workflow, exploring agent-based approaches for automating coding tasks. It includes a skeleton **AGENTS.md** file for documenting agents, commands and examples.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to experiment with autonomous agents that can assist in coding tasks, such as generating boilerplate code, running tests and suggesting improvements. The prototype will evolve as we add more agents and refine the workflow.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Review the `AGENTS.md` file to understand the available agent commands and examples.  
3. Contribute by adding new agents or improving the workflow.

## Files

- `AGENTS.md` – Documentation skeleton for agents, commands and examples.  
- `README.md` – This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to propose improvements or new features.
